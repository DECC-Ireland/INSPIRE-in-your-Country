## Introduction

This country fiche highlights Austria’s progress in the various areas of INSPIRE implementation. It contains information covering the period **up to March 2024**.

Austria has transposed the INSPIRE Directive into Austrian law by adopting a federal act at national level (Spatial Data Infrastructure Act – Geodateninfrastrukturgesetz, GeoDIG (Federal Law Gazette I No 14/2010 as amended by Federal Law Gazette I No 109/2012) and nine spatial data infrastructure laws at regional level (in the federal provinces/Länder).

In 2015, the EU Commission held a meeting with Austria concerning the necessary full implementation of the INSPIRE Directive (pre-pilot bilateral technical meeting). As a result, Austria drew up an Action Plan to (further) ensure and achieve proper implementation of the Directive. The Action Plan was at-tached to Austria’s report in 2016. One of the measures detailed in the Action Plan was the estab-lishment of a helpdesk to provide public authorities with technical support for INSPIRE implementa-tion. The extended activities help implementing the INSPIRE Directive, while also contributing to the EU’s Digital Single Market.

#### Coordination Structure & Progress: 

##### Coordination structure

-	As Austria has a federal system of government, coordinating structures have been established at national and regional (provinces/Länder) level.
-	The Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Regions and Water Management (Bun-desministerium für Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Regionen und Wasserwirtschaft, BML) has set up a national coordination body for implementing INSPIRE, which consists of authorised representatives from federal ministries (whose scope of responsibili-ties includes INSPIRE spatial data sets or services), and of representatives from the provinces and the Austrian association of cities and municipalities (as illustrated be-low).
-	The national coordination body is assisted by experts or temporary working groups as required.
-	Further information on INSPIRE in Austria can be found on  www.inspire.gv.at.
##### Progress

Member States are given some leeway as to how they deal with the technical implementation of the INSPIRE Directive, which has an impact on the functional quality of INSPIRE infra-structure. For this reason, additional measures and mechanisms are used for INSPIRE in Austria to ensure the applicability of INSPIRE and quality improvement:
-	National helpdesk: supports Austrian public data providers (public authorities) in the enforcement of laws implementing the INSPIRE Directive, in the implementation of the Directive and of the directly applicable implementing acts of the INSPIRE Di-rective. In addition to technical content and support, tools for the validation of metadata, network services and data provided by the EC – which are currently only partially functional - are tested and the knowledge generated is passed on to the spatial data providers.
-	Working group on metadata: defines a national understanding for a harmonised gen-eration and maintenance of metadata
-	Working group on network services: assists in the establishment of network services and technology selection and conducts implementation tests – e.g. tests for imple-menting a national validation service 
-	Working group on data harmonisation: helps to coordinate the process of data har-monisation as required
-	Working group on validation: supports in the area of data and service validation, tests for implementing a national validation service
-	Registry working group: operates the national registry and maintains the registry en-tries
