## Introduction

The INSPIRE Directive sets the minimum conditions for interoperable sharing and exchange of spatial data across Europe as
part of a larger European Interoperability Framework and the e-Government Action Plan that contributes to the Digital Single
Market Agenda. Article 21 of INSPIRE Directive defines the basic principles for monitoring and reporting. More detailed
implementing rules regarding INSPIRE monitoring and reporting have been adopted as Commission Implementing Decision
(EU) 2019/1372 on the 19th August 2019.

This country fiche highlights the progress in the various areas of INSPIRE implementation. It includes information on monitoring
2023 acquired in December 2023 and Member States update.


## State of Play

A high-level view on the governance, use and impact of the INSPIRE Directive in Estonia. More detailed information is available
on the INSPIRE knowledge base.

### Usage of the infrastructure for spatial information <a name="usage"></a>

The usage of INSPIRE spatial information has been stabilized in couple of years. There are also no significant changes
on comparing Estonian INSPIRE view or download services. One of the main reason could be that the Estonian Land
Board published in 1 July 2018 most of its spatial data as open data. As most of the Estonian INSPIRE services in 2018
and 2019 were INSPIRE I and II annexes themes and Estonian Land Board was mostly these themes data owner. New
annex III services are also mostly open data and did not make a big new open data releasing effect. Local public sector
preferred to use other possibilities than INSPIRE to collect data.


### Data Sharing Arrangements <a name="data"></a>

From 2018 the spatial data of the Estonian Land Board is available for free download to everyone. As a result, there is no
need to ask spatial data from Estonian Land Board in a query format. INSPIRE data and services were also directly
affected by this decision and are mostly free of charge. For the conditions of use Estonian Land Board has made their
own Land Board Open Data License.
Environmental spatial data is also mostly free of charge but is not so easily usable for people. To represent spatial location
and basic attributes The Estonian Environment Information Centre has published simple environmental spatial data view
and download services. More detailed information is exchanged with government institutions.
For data exchange between government institutions there is an overall agreement that data exchange is free from charge.

### Costs and Benefits <a name="costs"></a>

Compared to 2021 the costs of 2022 have no significant changes. Implementation of the INSPIRE Directive vary between
actors and are difficult to estimate precisely. Most of the workers in the responsible authorities of INSPIRE data are doing
it as part of their daily job responsibilities and do not get extra benefit for it.
Coordination costs have been the salary costs of two employees in the Estonian Land Board, who coordinate the
entire implementation of the INSPIRE Directive in Estonia. The workload of these two people on INSPIRE topics
corresponds to 0.5 per full-time workload for the whole reporting period. In addition, the Land Board has 3 people
dealing with different INSPIRE topics: communication with information holders, technical advice, participation in
workgroups, metadata filling, monitoring and management, reporting, planning of Estonian geoportal development,
etc. The workload of these people is estimated to be a full-time workload of 2.5 persons for the whole reporting
period.
Information Technology Centre of the Ministry of the Environment has made the salary costs and technical costs in
a value of EUR 90 000. They have 3 workers assigned on INSPIRE whom workload corresponds to 2.5 per full-time
workload for the whole reporting period.
Benefits of 2022 implementing the INSPIRE Directive vary between actors. The monetary value information of the total
benefits is currently unavailable. According to Estonian Land Board INSPIRE workgroup experiences, the key benefits
can be summed up as:
organizing and re-developing databases has made data (especially environment data) more accessible and clearer
to all users;
the cooperation between actors have increased (interinstitutional cooperation);
opportunities to use and implement new technical solutions nationally;
overall data discoverability and availability increase.
