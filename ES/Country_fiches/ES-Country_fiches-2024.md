## Introduction

The INSPIRE Directive sets the minimum conditions for interoperable sharing and exchange of spatial data across Europe as part of a larger European Interoperability Framework and the e-Government Action Plan that contributes to the Digital Single Market Agenda. Article 21 of INSPIRE Directive defines the basic principles for monitoring and reporting. More detailed implementing rules regarding INSPIRE monitoring and reporting have been
adopted as [Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1372](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2019/1372/oj) on the 19th August 2019.

This country fiche highlights the progress in the various areas of INSPIRE implementation. It includes information on [monitoring 2023](https://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/catalog/views/inspireportal/monitoringreporting/site/mr2023_details.html?country=es) acquired in December 2023 and Member States update.

## State of Play

Spanish SDI (Infraestructura de datos Espaciales de España, IDEE)

![Spanish SDI logo](https://www.idee.es/resources/presentaciones/CODIIGE/CountryFiche2020/IDEE.png)

Spain transposed INSPIRE Directive into national law since 2010, called [**LISIGE** "Law about Infrastructures and Services about Geographic information in Spain"](https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2010/07/06/pdfs/BOE-A-2010-10707.pdf), and has been implemented and maintainted the national INSPIRE nodes and regional INSPIRE nodes since then.

Spatial datasets contained in the SDI of Spain:
- All annex I dataset have been harmonised from the beginning and the harmonisazion of Annex II and III data has been planned in following years road map which is being transposed.
- Priority datasets have identified and published through view and download services.
- High-value datasets defined in Regulation (EU) 2023/138 classified as geoespatial, earth observation and environment and mobility.

[**Spanish SDI geoportal**](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/inicio) is the access point national and regional SDI have two catalogues, tools and publishes their information thought view and download services.

#### Coordination Structure & Progress: 

##### Coordination structure

[Geographic High Council](https://www.transportes.gob.es/organos-colegiados/consejo-superior-geografico/csg) is the director body of the National Cartographic System (SCN), having consultation and planning role for the official geographic information and cartography. Geographic High Council is the National Contact Point for INSPIRE and the coordination and direction for the Spanish SDI.
![Spanish SDI coordination](https://www.idee.es/resources/presentaciones/CODIIGE/CountryFiche2020/CSG_CODIIGE.jpg)
Geographic High Council created the **[Executive Board of the Geographic Information Infrastructure of Spain](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/codiige)** (CODIIGE) for managing and controlling IDEE. It takes responsibility for directing Spain's SDI, and immediately began to define the Technical WGs with the objective of analysing the application of the implementing rules of INSPIRE by the Spanish Public Administrations and helping their bodies and Organizations to achieve compliance. Furthermore, it is the body responsible for coordination and management of the SDI of Spain, owing to which it is responsible for its constitution and maintenance, being responsible for:
1. Proposing to the competent Authorities the actions to be performed by the Administrations or Organizations of the public sector for the establishment of the IDEE.
2. Guaranteeing its accessibility and interoperability.
3. Integrating the contributions of other producers or suppliers.

The [CODIIGE](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/codiige) deal with interinstitutional coordination the organization of Spanish SDI (IDEE) is based on 14 national and 17 regional nodes; each regional node establishes the necessary coordination with the local administration and other agents.
**National and Regional SDI nodes**

Depending on [**CODIIGE**](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/codiige):
- There are some [Thematic Working Groups (GTT)](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/codiige#grupostt), (one per INSPIRE Theme although some themes are grouped) with representation of all institutions with responsibility for data and/ or services under scope of INSPIRE. These Thematic Working Groups (GTT) have translated INSPIRE Technical Guidelines (Data Specifications) and have adapted to the case of Spain. These technical documents are available here.
- Identification of priority data through environment ministries: The [Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA)](https://www.mapa.gob.es) and the [Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO)](https://www.miteco.gob.es/es.html).
- Furthermore, there are four transversal Working Groups (Metadata and catalogue; Network services; Monitoring and reporting; Data and services policy).
- Finally, there is a Working Group for the NSDI (GTIDEE) with representatives from public and private sector and academia. GTIDEE meets 2 times a year to discuss different aspects of the standars, Technical Guidance, open data and new technologies for the implementation of INSPIRE, Iberian Conference SDI and to coordinate the experts work on INSPIRE.
- Responsible for [**Spanish SDI Geoportal**](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/inicio) and their catalogues.
  - [Spanish SDI Catalogue](https://www.idee.es/csw-inspire-idee/srv/spa/catalog.search)
  - [Official Catalogue of Inspire Data and Services (CODSI)](https://www.idee.es/csw-codsi-idee/srv/spa/catalog.search#/home) 

The [National Cartographic System](http://www.scne.es/productos.html), defined in Royal Decree 1545/2007 and promoted by Law 14/2010, which establishes the coordination of data production via the National Cartographic Plan and the sharing of data between the Autonomous Communities that sign the generic agreement and the General State Administration. The Geographic High Council is the management body of the National Cartographic System and and is made up of the following national and regional bodies, see here.
- On the following web page, you can consult the dates of the agreements of each of the autonomous organisations. see [here.](https://www.scne.es/miembros.html)
