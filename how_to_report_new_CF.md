#  How to report new Country fiche

To report a new Contry fiche for your Member State, please follow the instruction below:

- Fork the INSPIRE-in-your-Country repository (For more information, see "[Working with forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks)").
- In the forked repository, create a new _md_ file in the folder related to your country (e.g. _/INSPIRE-in-your-Country/AT/Country_fiches/_), naming it using the following name structure "\<MS-code>-Country\_fiche-\<Year>.md_" (e.g. _AT-Country_fiches-2024.md_) and using the document structure provided in the [country fiche template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INSPIRE-MIF/INSPIRE-in-your-Country/main/Country_fiche_Template.md) (you can copy/paste the markdown syntax).
- Edit your new country fiche and commit your changes.
- When finished, create a pull request to propose changes you've made to the fork of the INSPIRE-in-your-Country repository (For more information, see "[Creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)").


Use the [*Issue tracker*](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/INSPIRE-in-your-Country/issues/new) to report issues with this procedure.
