## Introduction

The INSPIRE Directive sets the minimum conditions for interoperable sharing and exchange of spatial data across Europe as part of a larger European Interoperability Framework and the e-Government Action Plan that contributes to the Digital Single Market Agenda. Article 21 of INSPIRE Directive defines the basic principles for monitoring and reporting. More detailed implementing rules regarding INSPIRE monitoring and reporting have been
adopted as [Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1372](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2019/1372/oj) on the 19th August 2019.

This country fiche highlights the progress in the various areas of INSPIRE implementation. It includes information on [monitoring 2023](https://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/catalog/views/inspireportal/monitoringreporting/site/mr2023_details.html?country=es) acquired in December 2023 and Member States update.

## State of Play

**Spanish SDI (Infraestructura de datos Espaciales de España, IDEE)**

![Spanish SDI logo](https://www.idee.es/resources/presentaciones/CODIIGE/CountryFiche2020/IDEE.png)

Spain transposed INSPIRE Directive into national law since 2010, called [**LISIGE** "Law about Infrastructures and Services about Geographic information in Spain"](https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2010/07/06/pdfs/BOE-A-2010-10707.pdf), and has been implemented and maintainted the national INSPIRE nodes and regional INSPIRE nodes since then.

Spatial datasets contained in the SDI of Spain:
- All annex I dataset have been harmonised from the beginning and the harmonisazion of Annex II and III data has been planned in following years road map which is being transposed.
- Priority datasets have identified and published through view and download services.
- High-value datasets defined in Regulation (EU) 2023/138 classified as geoespatial, earth observation and environment and mobility.

[**Spanish SDI geoportal**](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/inicio) is the access point national and regional SDI have two catalogues, tools and publishes their information thought view and download services.

#### Coordination Structure & Progress: 

##### Coordination structure

[**Geographic High Council**](https://www.transportes.gob.es/organos-colegiados/consejo-superior-geografico/csg) is the director body of the [National Cartographic System (SCN)](https://www.scne.es/), having consultation and planning role for the official geographic information and cartography. Geographic High Council is the National Contact Point for INSPIRE and the coordination and direction for the Spanish SDI.
![Spanish SDI coordination](https://www.idee.es/resources/presentaciones/CODIIGE/CountryFiche2020/CSG_CODIIGE.jpg)
Geographic High Council created the **[Executive Board of the Geographic Information Infrastructure of Spain](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/codiige)** (CODIIGE) for managing and controlling IDEE. It takes responsibility for directing Spain's SDI, and immediately began to define the Technical WGs with the objective of analysing the application of the implementing rules of INSPIRE by the Spanish Public Administrations and helping their bodies and Organizations to achieve compliance. Furthermore, it is the body responsible for coordination and management of the SDI of Spain, owing to which it is responsible for its constitution and maintenance, being responsible for:
1. Proposing to the competent Authorities the actions to be performed by the Administrations or Organizations of the public sector for the establishment of the IDEE.
2. Guaranteeing its accessibility and interoperability.
3. Integrating the contributions of other producers or suppliers.

The [CODIIGE](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/codiige) deal with interinstitutional coordination the organization of Spanish SDI (IDEE) is based on 14 national and 17 regional nodes; each regional node establishes the necessary coordination with the local administration and other agents.

Depending on [**CODIIGE**](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/codiige):
- There are some [Thematic Working Groups (GTT)](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/codiige#grupostt), (one per INSPIRE Theme although some themes are grouped) with representation of all institutions with responsibility for data and/ or services under scope of INSPIRE. These Thematic Working Groups (GTT) have translated INSPIRE Technical Guidelines (Data Specifications) and have adapted to the case of Spain. These technical documents are available here.
- Identification of priority data through environment ministries: The [Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA)](https://www.mapa.gob.es) and the [Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO)](https://www.miteco.gob.es/es.html).
- Furthermore, there are four transversal Working Groups (Metadata and catalogue; Network services; Monitoring and reporting; Data and services policy).
- Finally, there is a Working Group for the NSDI (GTIDEE) with representatives from public and private sector and academia. GTIDEE meets 2 times a year to discuss different aspects of the standars, Technical Guidance, open data and new technologies for the implementation of INSPIRE, [Iberian Conference SDI](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/jiide) and to coordinate the experts work on INSPIRE.
- Responsible for [**Spanish SDI Geoportal**](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/inicio) and their catalogues.
  - [Spanish SDI Catalogue](https://www.idee.es/csw-inspire-idee/srv/spa/catalog.search)
  - [Official Catalogue of Inspire Data and Services (CODSI)](https://www.idee.es/csw-codsi-idee/srv/spa/catalog.search#/home) 

The [National Cartographic System](http://www.scne.es/productos.html), defined in Royal Decree 1545/2007 and promoted by Law 14/2010, which establishes the coordination of data production via the National Cartographic Plan and the sharing of data between the Autonomous Communities that sign the generic agreement and the General State Administration.
- The data production are orthoimagery, hidrography, transport networks, land use and cover, elevation (DTM, DSM), etc.
- The [National Cartographic System](https://www.scne.es/productos.php) is made up of the following national and regional bodies, see [here.](https://www.scne.es/miembros.html)
- On the following web page, you can consult the dates of the agreements of each of the autonomous organisations. see [here.](https://www.scne.es/miembros.html)

##### Progress

**High-Value Datasets (HVD)**

The CODIIGE has carried out a preliminary study of **High-Value Datasets (HVD)** to be made available for re-use according to [Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/138 of laying down a list of specific high-value datasets and the arrangements for their publication and re-use](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32023R0138).

All datasets (100 %) are available for re-use under the conditions of the Creative Commons BY 4.0 licence, or any equivalent or less restrictive open licence allowing for unrestricted re-use and their metadata elements set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008. Those HVD are accessible through their metadata in the [Official Catalogue of Inspire Data and Services (CODSI)](https://www.idee.es/csw-codsi-idee/srv/spa/catalog.search#/home).

|HVD accessible in the CODSI catalogue  | 2022 | 2023  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Geospatial  | 29  | 32  |
| Earth Observation and enviroment  | 184  | 253  |
| Mobility  | 3  | 3 |

**Spain’s recovery and resilience plan**
Procurement for the modernisation of the Spatial Data Infrastructure for Spain (IDEE) through the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan with an estimated budget of 11 052 000 € for the next 4 years (2021-2024). The contracts cover the following topics:
- Technological platform on the cloud.
- Adaptation of the IDEE to the new technological specifications such as the implementation and configuration of new network services compliant with INSPIRE Directive based on the API-OGC and development of client applications for their exploitation. (Examples of Spanish SDI OGC API [here](https://api-features.idee.es/))
- Postal address service web management system: Working on the creation of national geocoder service to publish official addresses that will be the result of the harmonization and integration of official addresses the main suppliers of information about addresses at national, regional and local government organizations. In this project involves Directorate General for Cadastre, Basque Government, Government of Navarre and another regions like Valencia, Madrid, Andalucía... All of them are supported with the Postal Codes provided by the Post Office Group, names of streets of National Statistics Institute together with the official settlements of National Geographic Institute (IGN Spain).
- Development of a national vector tile service: Creation of [**official base map multiscale**](https://ideespain.github.io/mapabase/) from official sources national, regional and local sources. Its technology is based on vector tile services.
- Design and implementation of the processes for the integration of traffic direction information from OSM into the transport network database of Spain.
- Maintenance of national catalogues, validation of metadata and publication on the open data portal

Strengthening the work carried out between the Cadastre and the Land Registry. The Spanish Law 13/2015 implements an effective coordination of transactions executed by Cadastre and the Property Rights Registry. These institutions are two separate organizations with differentiated mandates and competences, both working in the domain of land administration. The Cadastre, registries and notaries have worked together to design a technologically advanced model of institutional interaction for this coordination purpose based in the INSPIRE GML of the Cadastral Parcel and the position of the Building.

Navarra Territorial Information System (SITNA) [Strategic Plan 2020-2023.](https://gobiernoabierto.navarra.es/es/gobernanza/planes-y-programas-accion-gobierno/plan-estrategico-del-sistema-informacion-territorial-2020-2023)

**Conferences and workshops in 2023**
The [**XIII Iberian Conference on Spatial Data Infrastructures**](https://www.idee.es/resources/presentaciones/JIIDE23/presentacionesJIDEE2023.pdf) 2023 was held in Évora (Portugal) from 6 to 8 november under the slogan "Contributions of spatial data infrastructures to high-value datasets” with a participation of 300 attendees mainly from Spain, Portugal and Andorra.

The [**Free GIS conferences 2023**](https://www.jornadassiglibre.org/) is an initiative of the [SIGTE](https://www.udg.edu/en/sigte/), a conference dedicated to the free software in the field of the Geographical Information Technologies. This event takes place at the University of Girona, since 2007.

Holding of two [Working Group for the NSDI (GTIDEE)](https://www.idee.es/en/web/idee/gtidee) meetings where MIG and MIG-T activities and other topics such as API-OGC are disseminated. (the number of attendees by meeting is around 140).

**Nex law**
Aragon government published the Law 3/2022, of 6 October, on Geographic Information in Aragon (LIGA)  with the aim of establishing a legal regime for the geographical information and cartographic activity of Aragon and its organisational and instrumental mechanisms, through which coordination and collaboration between the different regional and local public administrations, as well as with the private sector, will be determined with regard to its production, dissemination and access, improving efficiency, transparency, interoperability and speed in its management. LIGA defines the Knowledge Infrastructure of Aragon (ICEARAGON) as the computer system made up of a set of resources dedicated to managing geographic information, available on the Internet, which meet the interoperability conditions (standards, specifications, protocols and interfaces) that allow them to be used, combined and related according to different needs.

### Functioning and coordination of the infrastructure <a name="functioning"></a>

**Functioning**

- To facilitate data and service sharing and use has been developed:
  - Spanish SDI Geoportal (IDEE) provides access to around 46 catalogues from national, regional and local nodes.
  - Official Catalogue of Inspire Data and Services (CODSI) provides access INSPIRE data sets and network services. This catalogue is connected via harvesting or file interchange with the catalogues of national and regional SDI nodes, is the base for the monitoring process and for feeding the INSPIRE Geoportal. All INSPIRE compliant services available in Spain are available in European INSPIRE Geoportal.
  - [Spanish Registry](https://registro.idee.es/registry) based on [Re3gistry](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/re3gistry_en/).
- Much more OGC services are available but not all are INSPIRE compliant services.
- Navarre, Catalonia and National Cartographic System services publish their spatial data via OGC APIs
- The list of key spatial data sets required for other environmental policies is already identified.
- Big effort on training, seminars, events at regional and local levels; twitter @IDEESpain (2949 followers), electronic monthly bulletin [“SobreIDEs”](http://www.idee.es/boletin-sobre-ides) and Spanish SDI Blog ["Blog IDEE"](https://blog-idee.blogspot.com/) with the following numbers of articles per year:
  
|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|238|201|120|88|82 |
  
- Thematic Working Groups (GTT), was asked to produce Guides about how to make compliant with INSPIRE the identified datasets and the already implemented view and download services. These Thematic Working Groups (GTT) have translated INSPIRE Technical Guidelines (Data Specifications) and have adapted to the case of Spain. These technical documents are available here.

**INSPIRE priority dataset**

- Identification of priority data through environment ministries: The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA) and the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO).
- The MAPA and MITECO SDI Geoportal is the central access point to the INSPIRE priority data set provided for environmental reporting.

**Cadastral Parcels, Addresses and buildings**
- INSPIRE GML used as exchange format of Cadastral Parcels, Addresses and buildings in the real estate traffic in Spain. These themes are downloaded though ATOM service of General Directorate for Cadastre, Govern of Navarre and Basque government. These services allow the completed download by municipality of the INSPIRE data set.
- The Spanish Mortgage Law and the revised text of the Law of Real Estate Cadastre, following its reform by Law 13/2015, of 24 June, establish a system of coordination between the Cadastre and the Property Rights Registry, so that Property Rights Registry incorporates the georeferenced graphic description of the registered properties, using the cadastral cartography as a basis.

### Usage of the infrastructure for spatial information <a name="usage"></a>
