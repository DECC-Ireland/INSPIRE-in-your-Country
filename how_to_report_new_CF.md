#  How to report new Country fiche

To report a new Country fiche for your Member State, please follow the instructions below:

- Fork the INSPIRE-in-your-Country repository (For more information, see "[Working with forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks)").
- In the forked repository, create a new _md_ file in the folder related to your country, e.g. _/INSPIRE-in-your-Country/AT/Country_fiches/_ (For more information, see "[Creating new files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files)"), with the following characteristics:
  - the file name should follow the following naming structure "_\<MS-code>-Country\_fiche-\<Year>.md_", e.g. _AT-Country_fiches-2024.md_.
  - the document structure should follow the [country fiche template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INSPIRE-MIF/INSPIRE-in-your-Country/main/Country_fiche_Template.md) (you can copy/paste the markdown syntax).
- Edit your new country fiche (For more information on the use of the Markdown syntax, see "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)") and commit your changes.
- When finished, create a pull request to propose changes you've made to the fork of the INSPIRE-in-your-Country repository (For more information, see "[Creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)").
